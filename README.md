# Adapt &amp; AdaptUI 

__Adapt__ is a UI library to create decoupled widget components. They can be
  used in a `RecyclerView`, `ListView`, inside a `LinearLayout` or used directly as a `View` interchangeably, 
  no code involved. One `Item` to rule them all. Layout preview enabled.

__AdaptUI__ is en enhanced Android view DSL builder that brings together dynamism 
  and flexibility of __Adapt__ to native Android views. It aims to provide convenience 
  and peace of mind for developers, meanwhile fixing pain points 
  of Android XML - missing composability, reuse and customization. They are all included out of box. 
  It is a _disappearing_
  view and layout builder that gives total control of created views, without imposing any
  limitations or forcing the use of certain tools or compilers. A view is a view. As it should have been.

ðŸš§ All showcase previews can be accessed via [dedicate page](./PREVIEW_SHOWCASE.md)

ðŸš§ Documentation might still be a bit lacking, but most of the features in `adapt-ui` module
  come with a [dedicated sample](./sample/src/main/java/io/noties/adapt/sample/samples) class file. 
  What better can explain the functionality than the code, right? ;)
