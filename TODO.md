* explicit tags in sample (enum?), define colors for each

- [ ] window insets
- [ ] Int.unused in shape builder functions (where applicable)
- [ ] shape rotation, scale

- [X] layout width|height when used with layoutWeight - anyway it is a proper way to define such a view
  it is better to make weight explicit in `layout` function call for LinearLayout
