* explicit tags in sample (enum?), define colors for each

- [ ] window insets
- [ ] Int.unused in shape builder functions (where applicable)
- [ ] shape, stroke width, stroke gap and stroke dash to be relative?
- [ ] asset with stroke..

  it is better to make weight explicit in `layout` function call for LinearLayout
- [X] shape rotation
